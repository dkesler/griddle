# Griddle

The Griddle project is a set of plugins that empower Gradle to understand how to manage and generate thrift files.  These plugins provide features such as

* Exporting the idl of a project so that any consumer can generate that idl in the language of its choice with the generator of its choice
* Allowing idl files in one project to `include` idl files that live in another gradle subproject, in another gradle project, or in any arbitrary jar
* Easy, portable generation using Twitter's [Scrooge](https://github.com/twitter/scrooge) generator or the default [Apache Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/) generator

# Plugins

## The Idl Plugin

The `idl` plugin enables Gradle to understand and manage idl based dependencies and provides basic support for projects that want to generate thrift files.  It provides 

* Two new Configurations
* Three new tasks: `idlJar`, `copyDependencyIdl`, and `copyIncludedIdl`
* Options to control the directories containing thrift files or used by the thrift generation process

### Configurations

#### idl

The `idl` configuration indicates that the dependency (and/or one or more of its transitive dependencies) has exported thrift files in its jars, and those thrift files should be generated by a consuming project.  All `idl` dependencies are automatically added to the `compile` configuration

#### compiledIdl

The `compiledIdl` configuration, much like the `idl` configuration, indicates that the dependency and/or one or more of its transitive dependencies) has exported thrift files in its jars.  However unlike the `idl` configuration, those thrift files have already been generated.  This is used to indicate dependencies whose exported thrift files may be `include`ed by the dependent project.  All `compiledIdl` depenencies are added to the `compile` configuration.

### Tasks

#### idlJar

By default, all source thrift files of projects using the `idl` plugin will be included in the default jar produced by the project.  In the event that you want a jar containing _only_ the thrift files of the project, you may use the `idlJar` task.  It will create a jar with the classifier `idl` containing only the source thrift files of the project.  The jar is added as an artifact of the project's `idl` configuration.  Thus other projects can specify that their dependency on this project use the `idl` configuration and get the idl jar, rather than the default jar.

#### copyDependencyIdl and copyIncludedIdl

These tasks are responsible for copying idl from `idl` and `compiledIdl` dependencies respectively into a defined location so that generators can generate or include them.  You should never need to manually configure these tasks.  Instead, utilize the configuration options below.

### Configuration Options

The `idl` plugin adds four configuration options directly to each gradle project using the `idl` plugin.

#### thriftSrcDir

This option indicates the directory containing the source thrift files for the project.  It defaults to "src/main/thrift".  Any directory structure under thriftSrcDir will be preserved when the thrift files are exported in the project's jar files.

#### thriftGenDir

This option indicates the directory that generators should generate real source files into.  It defaults to "build/gen-src".

## The Thrift Plugin

In addition to applying the `idl` plugin, the `thrift` plugin adds the capability to generate thrift files using the standard Apache Thrift generator in any language supported by that generator.  It will also integrate the interface generation process into the Java build process.

### Tasks

#### generateInterfaces

The `generateInterfaces` task will automatically generate all thrift files provided by `idl` dependencies or under the `thriftSrcDir` specified for the project.  By default, it will generate java classes using the `java:hashcode` generator.  This can be overridden by setting the `language` property on the `generateInterfaces` task to any language supported by the thrift generator you are using.  The `generateInterfaces` task assumes that there will be a thrift generator binary named `thrift` on the `PATH`.  If you would rather explicitly specify the location of the thrift binary, you can override the `generator` property of the `generateInterfaces` task. 

## The Scrooge and Scrooge-Java plugins

Much like the `thrift` plugin, the `scrooge` and `scrooge-java` plugins integrate idl generation into the scala or java build processes respectively, using Twitter's Scrooge generator instead.

### Configurations

#### scroogeGen

The scrooge plugins add a `scroogeGen` configuration.  This should be used to specify the dependency on the desired version of the scrooge generator jar.  This configuration is _not_ applied as a `compile` dependency, so you will need to additionally specify a `compile` dependency on the desired version of the scrooge runtime.

### Tasks

#### generateInterfaces

The `generateInterfaces` task will automatically generate all thrift files provided by `idl` dependencies or under the `thriftSrcDir` specified for the project.  The `scrooge` plugin will generate native scala interfaces while the `scrooge-java` plugin will generate java interfaces.  By default, they will both generate [finagled](https://github.com/twitter/finagle) interfaces.  This can be disabled by setting the `useFinagle` property on the `generateInterfaces` task to false.


# Interaction With Idea/Eclipse Plugins

If you are using the [IntelliJ Idea](http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/idea_plugin.html) or Eclipse plugins alongside the `thrift`, `scrooge`, or `scrooge-java` plugins, the `thrift` and `scrooge` plugins will perform a few additional steps to ensure that the project files are generated correctly.  Both the `idea` and `eclipse` plugins requires that the `thriftGenDir` folder exist when the `ideaModule` or `eclipseClasspath` tasks run, otherwise it will not be added as a project source directory.  Thus the plugins will ensure those folders are created before the idea module files or eclipse classpath fiels are generated.  Be careful as this will NOT work if you import the gradle project from Eclipse directly.  The folders will be created, but Eclipse will not refresh its view of the filesystem before setting the source directories, resulting in the `thriftGenDir` folder not being added as a source directory.  (As a workaround, you will need to run `gradle generateInterfaces` before importing the project).

By default, the the generator projects generate into a folder under the build directory, however this directory is automatically marked as excluded by the idea plugin and will not be added as a project source directory within Idea.  To get around this, the plugins unmark `buildDir` as an excluded directory (and mark a number of other expected subdirectories of buildDir as excluded).  

# Sample Usages

The following sample build.gradle files correspond to projects in the sample-projects folder.  Each demonstrates a model of how one or more of the Griddle plugins can be used.  The sample projects will all build via a `gradle build` command.  You may need to provide a `thrift` binary available on your `$PATH` for projects using the `thrift` plugin.  Note that some of the sample build.gradle files below are incomplete as they have been edited for brevity.  Refer to the build.gradle files in the sample projects for the full, working build files.

## Adding Griddle Plugins To Your Build

Griddle is available in [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/).  To enable your projects to use the Griddle plugins, add the following to your root `build.gradle` file:

`build.gradle`

    buildscript {
        repositories() {
            mavenCentral()
        }
        dependencies {
            classpath 'com.yodle.griddle:griddle:1.7'
        }
    }

You can, of course, replace `mavenCentral()` with any repository which either is configured to pull unknown jars from Maven Central or to which you have manually deployed the Griddle jar.  For brevity, this code is omitted from all subsequent sample build.gradle files.

## Single Project

The following is a sample single-project build.gradle file that is using the `scrooge` plugin to generate thrift files that are located in the non-standard directory 'resources/idl'.  This model is useful when you have no cross-project idl dependencies and only need a single generator.

`build.gradle`

    apply plugin: 'scrooge'

    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
        // Selects which generator to use for the idl
        scroogeGen "com.twitter:scrooge-generator_2.10:3.13.2"

	//Compile time dependencies for the generated interfaces
        compile "org.scala-lang:scala-library:2.10.3"
        compile "com.twitter:scrooge-runtime_2.10:3.13.2"
        compile "org.apache.thrift:libthrift:0.5.0"
    }

    //non-standard configuration
    thriftSrcDir = "${projectDir}/resources/idl"

## Heterogeneous Generators

This example shows how `idl` dependencies can be chained along and generated in a terminal 'consumer' project, each of which is responsible for generating the idl in the manner that it chooses.  This is useful when you have a few projects each of which is set up to use their own generators or if you do not want to share compiled code across repositories. The projects in the example are as follows:

* 'idl-base' contains a base thrift file,
* 'idl-dependent' is an idl project whose files `include` the base thrift file in `idl-base`
* 'java-consumer' is a java project which has an `idl` dependency on the idl projects so that it can generate them locally using Thrift
* 'scala-consumer is a scala project which has an `idl` dependency on the idl projects so that it can generate them locally using Scrooge

Note that the below examples exclude the specification of repositories and additional compile-time dependencies for the sake of brevity

`idl-base/build.gradle`

    apply plugin: 'idl'

`idl-dependent/build.gradle`

    apply plugin: 'idl'

    dependencies {
        idl project(':idl-base')
    }  

`java-consumer/build.gradle`

    apply plugin: 'thrift'
    
    dependencies {
        idl project(':idl-dependent')
    }

`scala-consumer/build.gradle`

    apply plugin: 'scrooge'

    dependencies {
        idl project(':idl-dependent')
    }

## Incremental Generation

The above approach works well if you need the flexibility of each consumer generating interfaces for itself or if different consumers are under the control of different teams.  However this can lend itself to inefficiency as the same interfaces get generated and compiled multiple times by each consumer.  This example shows how to perform incremental generation of the interfaces so that they are only generated and compiled once, albeit at the cost of only allowing for one generator type.

* 'idl-base' contains a base thrift file,
* 'idl-dependent' is an idl project whose files `include` the base thrift file in `idl-base`
* 'consumer' is a java project which consumes the already generated interfaces of the idl projects

`idl-base/build.gradle`

    apply plugin: 'thrift'

`idl-dependent/build.gradle`

    apply plugin: 'thrift'

    dependencies {
        //we specify a compiledIdl dependency because we want to specify that the dependency contains thrift files, but we don't want to generate them as we would an idl dependency
        compiledIdl project(':idl-base')
    }

`consumer/build.gradle`

    apply plugin: 'java'

    dependencies {
        compile project(':idl-dependent')
    }


## Incremental Generation With Multiple Generators

This example demonstrates the best way we've currently found of enabling incremental generation with multiple different generators.  It does begin to increase the complexity of the project layout, especially in the presence of idl dependencies between projects, but saves a substantial amount of computation over having each consumer of the interfaces generate and compile the same interfaces over and over.  This example also demonstrates how incremental generation can co-exist with non-incremental generation.

* 'idl-base' contains a base thrift file
* 'idl-base/thrift' is responsible for generating the base thrift file using Thrift
* 'idl-base/scrooge' is responsible for generating the base thrift file using Scrooge
* 'idl-dependent' contains a thrift file which `include`s the file in `idl-base`
* 'idl-dependent/thrift' is responsible for generating `idl-dependent`'s idl using Thrift
* 'idl-dependent/scrooge' is responsible for generating `idl-dependent`'s idl using Scrooge
* 'thrift-consumer' consumes the thrift interfaces generated by `idl-dependent/thrift`
* 'scala-consumer' consumes the thrift interfaces generated by `idl-dependent/scrooge`
* 'non-incremental-consumer' is a consumer that ignores the incrementally generated interfaces and generates all of its dependencies itself

`idl-base/build.gradle`

    apply plugin: 'idl'

`idl-base/thrift/build.gradle`

    apply plugin: 'thrift'
    
    dependencies {
        idl project.getParent() 
    }

`idl-base/scrooge/build.gradle`

    apply plugin: 'scrooge'
    
    dependencies {
        idl project.getParent() 
    }

`idl-dependent/build.gradle`

    apply plugin: 'idl'

    dependencies {
        idl project(':idl-base')
    }

`idl-dependent/thrift/build.gradle`

    apply plugin: 'thrift'

    dependencies {
        compile project(':idl-base:thrift')

        //this example uses project.getParent() rather than explicit dependencies on the parent because this setup can be extracted into an included .gradle file so it can be shared by a number of projects
        idl (project.getParent()) { transitive=false } //We exclude transitive dependencies here because we only want to generate the idl that is native to idl-dependent
        compiledIdl (project.getParent()) //But we need a compiledIdl dependency on our parent's transitive deps because those dependencies are included by our parent's thrift files, even though they are not generated
    }

`idl-dependent/thrift/build.gradle`

    apply plugin: 'scrooge'

    dependencies {
        compile project(':idl-base:scrooge')

        idl (project.getParent()) { transitive=false }
        compiledIdl (project.getParent())
    }

`thrift-consumer/build.gradle`

    apply plugin: 'java'
    
    dependencies {
        compile project(':idl-dependent:thrift')
    }

`scrooge-consumer/build.gradle`

    apply plugin: 'scala'
    
    dependencies {
        compile project(':idl-dependent:scrooge')
    }

`non-incremental-consumer/build.gradle`

    apply plugin: 'thrift'

    dependencies {
      idl project(':idl-dependent')
    }


## Idl Dependencies Via Jar

All the above examples demonstrate idl dependencies being propogated via gradle project dependencies.  However the gradle project that hosts the thrift files may not live in the same overall build as the project that consumes them.  This example demonstrates one set of projects producing idl jars and a separate project depending on them through an intermediate maven repo (on the local filesystem) rather than via a direct gradle project dependcency.  This example shows a pure `idl` dependency, however `compiledIdl` dependencies also work.  Jar based dependencies could be used in place of any of the project dependencies in any of the above sample projects.

Note that in the sample project itself, there is an explicitly added dependency from the consuming project to the producing projects' uploadArtifacts tasks.  This is done purely to enable a single `gradle build` to build the sample project.  In a real project, it would be expected that the producing projects would upload their atifacts to something like Nexus or Artifactory as one step, and as a completely separate step the consumer would be built and pull those artifacts down.


* 'idl-base' contains a base thrift file
* 'idl-dependent' contains a thrift file which `include`s the file in `idl-base`
* 'consumer' generates the thrift files provided by the idl projects as a jar retrieved through maven
